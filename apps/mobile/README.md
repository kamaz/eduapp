# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Firebase Auth (Email/Password) â€” Dev Wiring

- The app initializes Firebase in `lib/firebase.ts` using config from `app.json > expo.extra.firebase`.
- In development (`__DEV__`), it connects to the local Auth Emulator at `127.0.0.1:9099`.
- Start the emulator first: `pnpm -w dev:emulators`.
- Worker should validate emulator tokens (set `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:9099`).

Config location: `app.json` â†’ `expo.extra.firebase` (for dev placeholders).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
