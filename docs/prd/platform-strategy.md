# Platform strategy

## Tablet (Core Experience)

Tablets offer the ideal balance of interactivity, visual feedback, and accessibility for primary learners.

- Primary learning interface for children.
- Supports stylus input for handwriting, drawing, and annotation.
- Enables interactive exercises, gamified lessons, and real-time feedback.
- Allows camera-based capture of worksheets, lessons, or physical materials.
- Offline-first mode for uninterrupted learning during travel or limited connectivity.
- Integrates motion and focus tracking (optional parental consent).

## Physical (Print-Based Learning Experience)

Physical learning supports kinesthetic engagement, encourages focus away from screens, and maintains inclusivity for families with limited device access.

- The app automatically generates printable worksheets tailored to the childâ€™s age, skill level, and interests.
- Parents or tutors can print these exercises for offline, hands-on practice â€” ideal for early learners developing writing and fine motor skills.
- Once completed, the page can be scanned or photographed within the app.
- The AI evaluates correctness, handwriting quality, and neatness, then feeds results into the childâ€™s digital learning profile.
- Parents can store or share paper results through the app for longitudinal tracking.

## Mobile App (Parents, Tutors, and Teachers)

Mobile enables lightweight engagement for adults without interrupting their routines.

- Optimized for quick access to insights, assignments, and progress updates.
- Parents can log observations, track energy levels, or scan completed worksheets.
- Tutors and teachers can upload photos of materials or assign new exercises.
- Push notifications for reminders, wellbeing alerts, and learning achievements.
- Smartwatch integration handled via companion connection (Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin).

## Web App (Administrative and Extended Access)

The web platform is essential for scalability, data management, and professional collaboration.

- Used by teachers, schools, and tutoring centers to manage multiple children.
- Provides analytics dashboards, reporting tools, and curriculum tracking.
- Supports drag-and-drop lesson planning and custom content creation.
- Enables printing of worksheets and physical task packs.
- Secure role-based access for different personas.

## Wearable & IoT Integration (Optional)

Real-world data supports balanced learning that values wellbeing as much as academic progress.

- Integrates with smartwatches and wellbeing trackers to collect optional biometric data (e.g., heart rate, activity, rest).
- The Wellbeing AI Model uses this input to adjust lesson intensity and recommend breaks.
- All data is anonymized, consent-based, and fully compliant with child privacy standards (GDPR-K, COPPA).

## ðŸ§  Cross-Platform Continuity

All experiences â€” tablet, mobile, web, print, and wearables â€” are synchronized through a unified AI-driven cloud system, ensuring:

- Consistent understanding of progress, engagement, and wellbeing.
- Real-time updates across all devices and users.
- Context-aware recommendations (e.g., switching from digital to print tasks if a child seems overstimulated).
