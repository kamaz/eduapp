# 🎯 Target Audience

## Overview

The app builds a 360° profile of each child by combining data from multiple sources to understand their academic ability, interests, motivation, and wellbeing. The platform connects children, parents, tutors, and teachers in a collaborative learning ecosystem.
It adapts dynamically based on continuous feedback from everyone involved — creating a living, evolving profile of each child that grows smarter over time.

Every interaction — whether it’s a parent’s observation, a tutor’s note, or the child’s own feedback — strengthens the AI’s understanding of how that child learns best.

Each participant — child, parent, tutor, and teacher — contributes unique observations, forming a Unified Child Profile that captures:

- Learning preferences and interests
- Emotional state and engagement
- Health and wellbeing indicators (from smart devices like watches)
- Performance trends and progress against curriculum goals

This shared intelligence enables the AI to make context-aware recommendations that balance academic growth, wellbeing, and long-term potential.

### 👧 Child — The Learner

Age Range (Initial Target): 4–11 years (Early years to 11+ prep)

Needs:

- Learning that's fun, fair, and fitted to their ability.
- Recognition, motivation, and balance (not overwhelm).
- The feeling of being seen and understood — not compared.
- Get personalised exercises adapted to their interests, energy, and learning style.
- Learn through familiar themes — e.g., dinosaurs, games, or favorite stories — to make abstract ideas relatable.
- Receive instant feedback on answers, handwriting, and presentation.
- Track their own progress visually, celebrating milestones and achievements.
- Benefit from an AI that understands when they’re tired or distracted (via smartwatch data) and adjusts activity intensity or type accordingly.
- Engage in a balanced learning journey that values curiosity, confidence, and wellbeing — not just academic results.

Value Provided:

- Adaptive, gamified tasks that evolve with their feedback.
- Ability to express likes/dislikes ("I liked this story", "This was hard but fun").
- Prompts to share interests ("What’s your favourite book?", "Do you like building things?").
- Health-friendly reminders — hydration, short breaks, and "brain rest" cues.

Data Shared with AI:

- Enjoyment feedback after tasks (e.g., happy/neutral/sad face).
- Self-assessed difficulty ratings.
- Interests and preferred learning styles (stories, puzzles, visual cues).
- Simple wellbeing check-ins ("How do you feel today?").

This data helps the AI tailor future exercises — for example, switching from text-based tasks to hands-on examples if a child prefers visual learning.

### 👩 Parent — The Guide and Decision Maker

Profiles: Everyday parent and homeschooling parent.

Needs:

- To understand how their child learns, not just what they know.
- To receive specific ideas that fit their child’s temperament and interests.
- To maintain healthy study rhythms at home.
- Gain insight into how their child learns best — and receive AI-driven suggestions for activities, outings, and home-based lessons aligned with the national curriculum.
  Example: "Practice addition with a deck of cards" or "Visit the National Gallery to explore adjectives in paintings."
- Get help explaining difficult topics — the AI provides multiple approaches to present the same concept in ways that suit the child’s learning style.
- Plan learning activities and daily routines: reminders for breaks, hydration, mindfulness, and rest.
- Receive guidance on how to support their child’s academic journey and long-term goals, including exam readiness and future career orientation.
- Access a shared child profile that collects inputs from teachers, tutors, and smart devices — offering a holistic picture of progress and wellbeing.
  - For homeschooling parents:
  - Easily create lessons aligned with the national curriculum.
  - Generate printable or tablet-ready exercises tailored to the child’s level.
  - Discover ideas for off-site activities that reinforce classroom concepts through real-world experiences.

Value Provided:

- AI-driven insights combining academic data with family feedback ("Lily focuses better in the morning — schedule math earlier").
- Tools to log observations ("Child was tired after lunch", "Loved yesterday’s art-based math activity").
- Wellbeing prompts — reminders to plan breaks, meals, water, and rest.
- Suggestions for learning activities that match mood, weather, and energy level.
- Catch-up support when children miss school or lessons.

Data Shared with AI:

- Home observations (focus, motivation, energy levels).
- Activity feedback (what worked, what didn’t).
- Daily rhythm (when the child eats, drinks, or takes breaks).
- Emotional and behavioural notes ("Seemed frustrated by word problems").

Result:
The AI refines recommendations — e.g., "Try shorter reading sessions after lunch" or "Incorporate drawing when explaining story structure."

### 👩‍🏫 Tutor — The Learing Architect

Profile: Private tutors managing students’ academic gaps and exam readiness.

Needs:

- A fast way to understand the whole learner — not just their test scores.
- Efficient feedback tools to track progress across sessions.
- Access a child’s learning history and current performance instantly — no need to start from scratch.
- Get AI support for planning sessions, generating exercises, and tracking homework across multiple students.
- Receive suggestions for addressing learning gaps or preparing for exams.
- Assess homework directly within the app, even outside tutoring hours, with AI support for grading and feedback.
- Collaborate seamlessly with parents and teachers to align on the child’s progress.
- Log observations about focus, comprehension, or wellbeing — contributing to the unified child profile.

Value Provided:

- Unified learner profiles integrating data from home and school.
- Catch-up plans for children who missed material.
- Quick AI summaries ("Student performs best with visuals and real-life examples").
- The ability to log notes after each session ("Understood fractions better using pizza examples").

Data Shared with AI:

- Lesson performance and engagement.
- Observations about preferred teaching styles and progress patterns.
- Homework quality and time to complete.
- Notes about emotional tone (confidence, frustration, curiosity).

Result:
The AI adapts new exercises and reports across all connected adults — aligning tutor, parent, and teacher insight into a unified strategy for the child.

### 👩‍🏫 Teacher — The Curriculum Anchor

Profile: Classroom educators needing efficient differentiation and feedback loops.

### 🧠 The Shared Learning Graph

At the core of the platform is the AI Learning Graph — a continuously updated model of the child’s:

- Academic progress (curriculum mastery)
- Cognitive preferences (how they understand best)
- Emotional and wellbeing signals (energy, motivation, confidence)
- Context (recent activities, breaks, sleep, hydration)

Each persona contributes to this graph:

| Persona | Type of data                   | Example                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Child   | Enjoyment & self-assessment    | "This story was fun!"                         |
| Parent  | Daily routines & observations  | "Tired after lunch; prefers morning reading." |
| Tutor   | Session notes & learning style | "Understood faster with real-life examples."  |
| Teacher | Curriculum data & assessments  | "Ahead in numeracy; needs reading focus."     |
