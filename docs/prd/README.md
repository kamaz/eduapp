# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🧩 Problem Identification

Children learn best when education feels **personal**, **engaging**, and **connected to their world** — but today's learning materials are often **static**, **generic**, and **disconnected from individual needs or interests**.

Traditional classroom environments, constrained by large pupil-to-teacher ratios, make it difficult to give every child the tailored attention they deserve. As a result, children who struggle may fall further behind, while those who excel are often not challenged enough to reach their full potential or even fall behind as they are bored.

This imbalance creates two types of disengagement — frustration from those who find learning too hard, and boredom from those who find it too easy. **Both limit confidence, curiosity, and long-term academic growth.**

Parents, tutors, and teachers need a shared tool that adapts learning experiences to each child's ability, interest, and pace, while tracking their progress across the curriculum — ensuring that every child is **continuously supported**, **encouraged**, and **challenged to achieve greatness**.

### Problem Statement

- **Children** lose motivation when lessons are too difficult, repetitive, or not engaging enough for their ability level.
- **Advanced learners** aren’t pushed to excel because teachers must focus attention on struggling pupils.
- **Parents and tutors** lack the tools to personalize learning and monitor progress against both curriculum goals and long-term readiness (e.g., 11+, GCSE).
- **Teachers** have limited visibility into what happens at home or in tutoring sessions, creating fragmented progress data.
- **Families** lack a single, trusted platform to understand where the child is now, where they’re heading, and what they can do to help them get there.

### Proposed Solution

This application introduces an AI-powered learning companion that empowers children, parents, tutors, and teachers to co-create a personalized educational journey.

By analyzing lesson materials (photos, uploaded worksheets, or text), the system automatically:

- Generates adaptive exercises tailored to the child's ability, interest, and learning style.
- Aligns with the **UK National Curriculum**, ensuring that progress maps directly to academic milestones and exam readiness.
- Tracks the child's journey through both short-term achievements (lesson mastery) and long-term goals (curriculum completion, exam preparation).
- Provides AI-driven guidance for parents, such as:
  - "Your child would benefit from two reasoning challenges this week"
  - "Your child is ready to move to the next reading level."
  - "Visit the National Gallery this weekend and ask your child to describe paintings using adjectives — perfect for their literacy goals."
    These recommendations bridge digital learning with real-world experiences, making education natural, creative, and memorable.
- **Gamifies learning** to sustain motivation and build confidence through positive reinforcement and achievable challenges.

Future versions will expand the journey tracking system to include **soft skills** and **career orientation** — identifying a child’s natural strengths in logic, creativity, communication, and problem-solving to help guide future learning and interests.

### Example Scenario

Mezi, an 9-year-old preparing for her 11+ exam, is learning fractions. Her tutor uploads a photo of a worksheet, and the app instantly generates new fraction problems using examples from Mezi’s favourite topic — LEGO building.
Mezi completes the tasks on her tablet, receives immediate feedback, and earns achievement badges for accuracy and presentation.

The app recognizes Mezi’s proficiency and automatically introduces slightly more challenging problems, ensuring she stays engaged. His parents receive a visual progress dashboard showing that Mezi is ahead in fractions but could benefit from more reasoning practice.
They also see AI-guided suggestions for family activities — such as playing a card game involving fractions or using kitchen measurements to practice ratios — helping them reinforce learning effortlessly through play.

### ✅ Key Problems Solved

- Lack of personalized, adaptive learning materials for children aged 4+
- Low engagement and motivation due to generic exercises
- Limited feedback integration across children, parents, tutors, and teachers
- Poor visibility of progress and curriculum coverage
- Inefficient process for creating, tracking, and sharing child-specific learning activities

### 🎯 Mission Statement

> To help every child achieve greatness — by making learning personal, engaging, and continuously challenging at just the right level, empowering families and educators to guide each child’s journey toward lifelong success.

## 🎯 Target Audience

### Overview

The app builds a 360° profile of each child by combining data from multiple sources to understand their academic ability, interests, motivation, and wellbeing. The platform connects children, parents, tutors, and teachers in a collaborative learning ecosystem.
It adapts dynamically based on continuous feedback from everyone involved — creating a living, evolving profile of each child that grows smarter over time.

Every interaction — whether it’s a parent’s observation, a tutor’s note, or the child’s own feedback — strengthens the AI’s understanding of how that child learns best.

Each participant — child, parent, tutor, and teacher — contributes unique observations, forming a Unified Child Profile that captures:

- Learning preferences and interests
- Emotional state and engagement
- Health and wellbeing indicators (from smart devices like watches)
- Performance trends and progress against curriculum goals

This shared intelligence enables the AI to make context-aware recommendations that balance academic growth, wellbeing, and long-term potential.

### 👧 Child — The Learner

Age Range (Initial Target): 4–11 years (Early years to 11+ prep)

Needs:

- Learning that's fun, fair, and fitted to their ability.
- Recognition, motivation, and balance (not overwhelm).
- The feeling of being seen and understood — not compared.
- Get personalised exercises adapted to their interests, energy, and learning style.
- Learn through familiar themes — e.g., dinosaurs, games, or favorite stories — to make abstract ideas relatable.
- Receive instant feedback on answers, handwriting, and presentation.
- Track their own progress visually, celebrating milestones and achievements.
- Benefit from an AI that understands when they’re tired or distracted (via smartwatch data) and adjusts activity intensity or type accordingly.
- Engage in a balanced learning journey that values curiosity, confidence, and wellbeing — not just academic results.

Value Provided:

- Adaptive, gamified tasks that evolve with their feedback.
- Ability to express likes/dislikes ("I liked this story", "This was hard but fun").
- Prompts to share interests ("What’s your favourite book?", "Do you like building things?").
- Health-friendly reminders — hydration, short breaks, and "brain rest" cues.

Data Shared with AI:

- Enjoyment feedback after tasks (e.g., happy/neutral/sad face).
- Self-assessed difficulty ratings.
- Interests and preferred learning styles (stories, puzzles, visual cues).
- Simple wellbeing check-ins ("How do you feel today?").

This data helps the AI tailor future exercises — for example, switching from text-based tasks to hands-on examples if a child prefers visual learning.

### 🧠 The Shared Learning Graph

At the core of the platform is the AI Learning Graph — a continuously updated model of the child’s:

- Academic progress (curriculum mastery)
- Cognitive preferences (how they understand best)
- Emotional and wellbeing signals (energy, motivation, confidence)
- Context (recent activities, breaks, sleep, hydration)

Each persona contributes to this graph:

| Persona | Type of data                   | Example                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Child   | Enjoyment & self-assessment    | "This story was fun!"                         |
| Parent  | Daily routines & observations  | "Tired after lunch; prefers morning reading." |
| Tutor   | Session notes & learning style | "Understood faster with real-life examples."  |
| Teacher | Curriculum data & assessments  | "Ahead in numeracy; needs reading focus."     |
